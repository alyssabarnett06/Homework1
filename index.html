            <p>  Hello. My name is Alyssa Barnett. I am 22 years old and I am an apsiring Front End Web Developer. 
                My passion for this industry started back when I was in the 4th grade. 
                When I was younger, my parents could not get me away from my computer (especially when it was time do be doing my school work). 
                Along with my love for computers, I do like the typical "girly" things. Shopping and socializing are some of my other passions! </p>
                
            <p> Within the time of this bootcamp, I hope to achieve all my goals of being a developer and more. I know the outcome is going to be very rewarding!
                Hopefully, I will finally be able to travel the world as I have always dreamed of doing.</p>
